# TaskList
Task list app. First vanilla JS project.

This is basically a small app developed in vanilla JS from the Modern Javascript course by Brad from Traversy Media. 

It's a great project to get your feet wet as well as gaining knowledge and understanding more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

It lets you create a list of tasks by adding them one by one, and also filter among them. 

I learned a lot making this, I must say.

Feel free to use it!
